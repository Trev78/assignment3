Random Password Generator.

This assignment did not turn out quite the way I wanted it to. The generator returns a password, but I was unable to create the proper check for the password length. It will alert the user that the password does not meet the lenght criteria, but will not return to the begining of the process:

Instead it carries on with the questions about what the user would like to see in the password and returns a result of "undefined".

The steps are relatively easy to follow, the user clicks on the "Generate Password" button to begin the process, though now that I think of it, that prompt is not obvious and poses a problem to the user. Unless otherwise stated, how would the user know that the button engages the process?

I found that very hard and very confusing and I do not feel I did well with it at all. I had originally started something very different, that work---sort of. It ran through the process twice before generating a password. I give great credit to a fellow student for helping me with the code. He revealed to me that the best way he found to create the equation was to first create every possible combination and then start eliminating to create desired selected options.

I'm still lost, but now that I see it written out I can sort of glean some kind of understanding. Where to wirte and what to write still confuse me, so I keep trying, but I feel like I'm not getting anywhere.
