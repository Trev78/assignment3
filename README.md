Random Password Generator.

This assignment did not turn out quite the way I wanted it to. The generator returns a password, but I was unable to create the proper check for the password length. It will alert the user that the password does not meet the lenght criteria, but will not return to the begining of the process:

<img src="Assets\Screenshot (4).png">
<img src="Assets\Screenshot (5).png">

Instead it carries on with the questions about what the user would like to see in the password and returns a result of "undefined".
